Wake Word Detection Program Overview

This Python program listens for predefined wake words ("HELP PLEASE" and "EMERGENCY") and responds with an audio and textual acknowledgment, saying, "I will help you." It uses the speech_recognition library for voice input and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech output.

Features:
Wake Word Detection: Listens for specific phrases ("HELP PLEASE", "EMERGENCY").
Speech Recognition: Converts speech to text using the Google Web Speech API.
Text-to-Speech Response: Provides audible feedback when a wake word is detected.
Continuous Listening: Operates in an infinite loop, continuously awaiting wake words.
Prerequisites

Software Requirements
Python 3.7 or above.

Libraries:
speech_recognition
pyttsx3
Hardware Requirements
Microphone (for voice input).
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
Install Required Libraries
Run the following command to install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3
Usage
Run the Program
Execute the script in your Python environment:

bash
Copy code
python wake_word_detection.py
Speak a Wake Word
Speak one of the predefined wake words ("HELP PLEASE" or "EMERGENCY"). The program will:

Display the recognized speech in the terminal.
Respond with "I will help you" both as text and audio output.
Configuration
Adjust Wake Words
Modify the wake_words list in the code to add or change the phrases:

python
Copy code
wake_words = ["HELP PLEASE", "EMERGENCY", "NEW WAKE WORD"]
Adjust Ambient Noise Handling
If the program struggles to detect speech in noisy environments, increase the time for ambient noise adjustment:

python
Copy code
recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=2)
Troubleshooting
Speech Not Recognized

Ensure the microphone is functional and selected as the default audio input device.
Check internet connectivity for Google Web Speech API usage.
Error Messages

sr.UnknownValueError: The speech was not clear enough to be recognized.
sr.RequestError: Issues with the Google Web Speech API (e.g., connectivity problems).
Future Improvements
Support for multiple languages.
Integration with other APIs for enhanced actions upon wake word detection.
Customizable response actions.
